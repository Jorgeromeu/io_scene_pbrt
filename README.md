# io_scene_pbrt
Keep in mind the development is not done, it's in very early stages, so consider it early aplha.

Exporter for blender that exports the scene into pbrt's ascii file format. 
The resulting files can then be rendered with PBRT renderer.

This is still work in progress, so a lot of features are not complete yet.
But IÍ„'m actively working on it to add each feature to it.
